2. Introduce new abstractions
3. Change the architecture
4. Rename concepts or data structures
5. Add frameworks or libraries
6. Add logging, metrics, or configuration systems
7. Infer runtime behavior
8. “Improve” performance or structure
9. Refactor unrelated code
10. Be proactive or speculative

The AI is NOT allowed to:
