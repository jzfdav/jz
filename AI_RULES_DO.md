# AI Rules — DO

The AI MUST:

1. Follow DESIGN.md strictly
2. Implement ONLY what is explicitly requested in the prompt
3. Treat the human as the system architect
4. Keep implementations minimal and readable
5. Prefer simple, deterministic logic
6. Use existing data structures exactly as defined
7. Keep changes localized to the requested file or function
8. Preserve existing behavior unless explicitly told otherwise
9. Ask for clarification ONLY if the task is ambiguous
10. Default to doing LESS rather than more

If unsure, stop and ask rather than guessing.
