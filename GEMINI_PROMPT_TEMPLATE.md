You are assisting in implementing a Go CLI tool named `jz`.

Before responding, you MUST strictly follow these documents:
- DESIGN.md
- AI_RULES_DO.md
- AI_RULES_DONT.md

These documents define the architecture, scope, and constraints of the tool.
They are the single source of truth.

## Current Task

[DESCRIBE THE TASK HERE]

---

## Context (if needed)

[OPTIONAL: brief context such as existing structs, function signatures, or file paths]

---

## Output Requirements

- Implement ONLY what is described in **Current Task**
- Do NOT introduce new features, abstractions, or scope
- Use Go standard library only, unless explicitly stated
- Keep the implementation minimal and readable
- If something is ambiguous, STOP and ask a clarification question

---

## Notes

- The human owns all architectural decisions
- You are acting as an implementation engine, not a designer
- If unsure, do less, not more
